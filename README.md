This program can be run locally too. Clone this repository and open the `index.html` in browser. I have tested it to work in Firefox/Chrome in Mac OSX Lion. But expect it to work in other browsers as well.

The dictionary it currently uses is [js/words.js](https://github.com/amalakar/ruzzl/blob/master/js/words.js). Not all the words present there are accpted by **Ruzzle**. I will try to improve the dictionary over time, contributions are  welcome too.

It seemed to work pretty well. I was able to score **1235** from my avg score of 300ish.

It has the following features:
 
 - Generates all possible words from the input.
 - Shows the words one at a time starting from the longest word.
 - Show swipe direction so that the word could be easily enterted in the game.
 - Can be accessed via [web](http://amalakar.github.io/ruzzl/) or run locally without requiring network connection.
 - Also shows a color gradient along with swipe direction. This helps in quickly memorizing the swipe pattern.
